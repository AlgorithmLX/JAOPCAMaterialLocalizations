### Submitting and editing a language file
If you intend to submit or edit a language file, please be aware that the file must be in UTF-8 encoding.

[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is the recommended text editor for editing language files because it is capable of saving files in the correct format via the Encoding menu.

System default editors may not save files in the correct format.
